myParkingSpace
=========

My Parking Space is a proposed app for adding stickiness to one of my client's website by offering parking information to their visitors or to be used for any other parking need. It is based on the Google Maps API for the maps and Parkwhiz.com API for the parking information.

The location of the initial screen defaults to the White House in Washington, DC (not my client, unfortunately.) The map shows the available parking lots in the surrounding area with the markers color-coded by price. When the user clicks on a marker, an info panel will display the name and address of the lot highlighting the price and the available spots at the lot.

There is also a box with the parking lots listed in order of proximity to the requested address or destination. The clickable list shows the price and name of the parking lot. Clicking the name will take the user to the marker on the map displaying the info panel.
