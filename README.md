myParkingSpace
=========

My Parking Space is a proposed app for adding stickyness to one of my client's website by offering parking information to their visitors or to be used for any other parking need. It is based on the Google Maps API for the maps and Parkwhiz.com API for the parking information.

Map defaults to the White House in Washington, DC (not my client, unfortunately...) and shows on the map the available parking lots in the surrounding area color coded by price. When the user clicks on a marker, an info pannel will display the name and address highlighting the price and the available spots at the lot.

There is also a box with the parking lots listed in order of proximity to the requested address/destination. The clickable list shows the price and name of the lot. Clicking the name will take the user to the marker on the map.
